# Analysis of Retail Store
This project aims to analyze the dataset of superstore located in the USA and make various inferences such that it will help to increase the revenue of the store.

The analysis report has been generated by using analytics tools--Power BI. The dataset 'SampleSuperstore.csv' has total 9995 records with 13 parameters such as ship-mode, segment, country, city, state, postal code, region, country, sub-category, sales, quantity, discount and profit. With the help of various parameters, I have analyzed the data and thus, infering certain business strategies with the help of data driven decision-making.

To merge certain columns and remove few of them, I have used PowerQuery which is in-built in Power BI to run SQL queries. The final outcome, inferences and strategies are mentioned at the end of the report.

The Power BI tool can be downloaded frome here: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/

3. Analyze the data with the help of vizuals and use PowerQuery to run the SQL queries.
4. Publish the final report.
5. Open Power BI website and Login with your credentials
